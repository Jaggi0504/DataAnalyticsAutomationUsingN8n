Automated Data Analytics using N8n workflow

  • Used Nocodb as a Database platform: It is no code database platform that allows users to create and manage the database using a spreadsheet like structure
  • Used OpenAI credentials as the model (freely available on N8n)
  • Used simple memory available on N8n platform so that the model remembers last 10 chats and give the output

We can ask questions from the model directly after uploading the dataset in natural language and get the high-level understanding of the data. To my surprise, it gave quite good responses.
